**Important Update: Temporary Password Reset for Some Users**

We wanted to inform you that, due to a false alarm triggered by our fraud prevention system, the passwords for some users who signed up with credentials (username/password) have been reset. If you're affected by this, please email us at **support@predyx.com** with your username, and we'll provide manual instructions to reset your password.

This is only a temporary issue. In the next day or two, we'll release the password reset feature, which will allow you to reset your password seamlessly by providing your email on your profile page. 

As a precaution, we are temporarily disabling new sign-ups with credentials (username/password) until the password reset feature is available.

Please note, users who signed up using **Lightning Wallet** or **Google** are not affected by this.

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we resolve this.
